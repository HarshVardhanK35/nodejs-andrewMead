* Adding Support for File Uploads *
-------------------------------------
1. how we add support for file uploads for an express application?
-----
-> we are using "multer" the NPM library which manages the file uploads for an express application
-> so far we have sent JSON data from client to server as request body and server has parsed that data into JS object

1. installation-multer
-----
-> install "multer" in task-manager application
  -> cd task-manager >>> "npm i multer"

2. how we could add files to an express application >> we use index.js for simple upload example using multer
-----
const multer = require('multer')
-> load in multer >>> import the module

const upload = multer ({
  dest: 'images'                        // dest >>> destination which is for destination folder
})
-> configure multer >>>   which type of data we want to send to the sever either it's a pdf or jpg or docx or docx
...here we also set a folder-name for destination where we want to save the file we upload from POSTMAN

app.post('/upload', upload.single('upload'), (req, res) => {
  res.send()
})
-> here we gonna set a "POST" req to upload the files into the server
-> takes in
"path" ... 1
"return value form middleware-function" ... 2     >>> return value form middleware function of multer library that takes a single argument
"req handler" ... 3

NOTE:
-----
-> for this moment we use POSTMAN to upload files after that we learn how to upload files from a browser

about middleware function of multer
-----
-> as from the above example... we configured multer using "upload" so we use "single" method on it.
-> this single takes in a single argument a string type we use "upload"

Note:
-----
-> when we send a JSON as req body we use "Body" tab under the url-box -> "raw" select "JSON" -> and then we provide JSON data below
-> but now we have to send files to the server so we use "form-data" under the "Body" tab

example of real-time file uploading (TESTING)
-----
-> to upload a file use any text or images from your desktops
-> open "POSTMAN" >>> create a new "POST" HTTP request >>> url: {localhost:3000/upload}
-> hop on to form-data under body tab and there will be key-value pairs
  -> the key value must be same as the argument that we had provided inside "upload.single()" middleware function
-> key is "upload" and data must be file type select from the dropdown menu side to the key box
-> value while change and it asks us to select the file from our machine

check this:
-----
-> at last a folder on your "TESTING" directory will be created with name "images" (provided inside dest in configuration of multer)
-> there will be a file added here inside images directory and it is of type- binary data (VS code can not open it until we specify the extension that must match the file we uploaded before)

challenge:
-----
1. inside the working directory that is task-manager/ user-route... set an endpoint: users/me/avatar to upload an avatar using POSTMAN
2. setup an avatar directory using multer to store uploaded file from postman
3. set a name "avatar" inside multer middleware
4. send a "200" response back on success >>> test your work.
