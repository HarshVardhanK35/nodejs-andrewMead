Real Time Chat Application
--------------------------

Creating Chat App Project:
-------------------------
intro:
------
1. initialize NPM and install Express
    -> we use "npm init -y" to initialize npm and "npm i express" to install express

2. Setup a new Express Server
    -> Serve up the public directory
      - for this we have to work with "path" module >>> const path = require('path') -> (in-built module no need to install)
      - to get public directory we use "path.join" >>> const publicDirectoryPath = path.join(__dirname, "../public")
      - express static middleware to serve up content in the directory we use >>> app.use(express.static( <path to the folder> ))

    -> Listen on port: 3000

3. Create index.html inside public directory and render "Chat App" to the screen
    -> render "Chat App" in the body of HTML code

4. add scripts to the package.json and install nodemon
    -> npm install nodemon --save-dev
    -> run either "npm start" or "npm run dev" to run the Server

  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"
  }
