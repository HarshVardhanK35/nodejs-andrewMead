/MongoDB and Promises/
Intro...
Here we are going to learn only the basics.
1.  In this section, we learn how to connect nodejs app to a database to store user data.
2.  We are going to start an app which is Task Manger application.
3.  We are going to learn everything which is needed for development of an app.

MongoDB and NoSQL databases...
Intro
1.  We are going to learn about the database we will be using to store data (MongoDB).
2.  For this, we are going to have an authentication, CRUD operations and lot more.

MongoDB
1.  Visit “mongodb.com” which is an open-source database we can install it on all types of machines.
2.  We will use mongodb native driver to connect to database from nodejs to make CRUD operations with the data.
3.  This falls under a category of NoSQL database (NoSQL stands for Not Only Structured Query Language).

comparison of SQL and NoSQL databases...
SQl
1.  data is stored in the tabular format.
2.  individual items storage: row or a record
3.  there are columns with different user properties (name, age, id, email)

NoSQL
1.  data is stored in the collection format
2.  individual items storage: document (looks like JSON --- JSON representation)
3.  there are fields (name, id, age, email)

conclusion:
1.  collection is a list of entries these entries are referred to as documents and these documents have many fields as we need.

ex:
collection inside mongodb
[
  {
    "_id": "u124asfw13g"
    "name": "u1",
    "age": 32,
    "email": "u1@user.com"
  },
  {...}
]

Installation of mongodb on windows...

Installation of database GUI viewer... User interface to manage mongodb database and data it contains

Connecting and Inserting Documents...
1. create "task-manager" project directory -> initialize npm with "npm init -y" -> install mongodb with "npm i mongodb"
2. we have to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update & Delete) to manage our data.
3. remaining process is inside "mongodb.js" file.

-> learned how to insert data into a database using nodejs
-> while inserting data a unique identifier (_id) was generated automatically

explanation:
-> installed MongoDB NPM library >>> native driver created by MongoDB company >>> allowing us to connect to mongodb database from nodeJS.
-> connect method used to connect to specific server
-> used db() method on the client to get connection to specicfic database
