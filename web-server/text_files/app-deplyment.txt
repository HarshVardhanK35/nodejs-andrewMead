In this section...
-> You're gonna learn how to deploy application to a production server
-> we are gonna use Git, GitHub and Heroku tools

GIT >>> put our app under version control and track the changes
GITHUB >>> back up our code and collaborate with other developers
HEROKU >>> helps us to deploy Node.JS apps to a production server

Heroku's Command Line Tools >>>
--------------------------------------------
-> These gives us access to various commands we can use from the terminal to deploy code and deploy code, if there any changes.
-> But Heroku needs access to our project code so that can deploy our node apps

so login through terminal using Heroku's commands
1. Heroku login >>> to login into the account

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
-------------------------------------- Version Control -----------------------------------------------------------------------
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1. version control allows us to manage the versions of our code for node application
2. if we add a new feature the code changes and we have to track the changes of our code with version control

Install GIT:
-------------------------
>>> visit the exact site to install git
-> open a new terminal and check its version to check git was actually installed or not

Conclusion:
1. we put our project under version control to keep track of the changes
2. then we are gonna send the changes off to the Github and Heroku servers by running commands from the terminal

--------------------------------------------------- HOW? ---------------------------------------------------
1. when we create a project we track changes in it by using some git commands
2. the files we add into a project are untracked files
3. when we use a certain commands of git we can track the changes in our project that has two steps in that project
    1.step >>> we use "git add" command to take one or more files from untracked files state to staged state
    2.step >>> commit command -> takes all the files in staged state and bundle them up into a single commit and each commit has a unique identifier

--------------------------------------------------- Setting up SSH keys ------------------------------------------------------
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1. how Heroku and Github services can access the updated code?
    -> so to Github can be able to host the project by accessing the code and heroku deploy the Node app.

2. How to transfer the code from our machine to 3rd party apps and services
    -> So we have to use SSH keys to pass the code in a secure way

SSH >>> Secure Shell
---------------------------------
-> Gives us a means to securely communicate with another machine

>>> Steps to set up SSH keys
1. if on windows open git bash terminal or else open on normal command prompt for Mac or Linux users
2. then go into the directory using cd.
3. 1st check if there are any existing SSH keys on the machine.
  >>> "ls" using this command to list out all the contents in a directory

-> Run the command: "ls -a -l ~/.ssh"
    >>> -a flag: shows up the hidden files
    >>> -l flag: make the format easier to read
    >>> last is the path to the directory or folder which we are trying to print its contents.

-> if we have the ssh keys inside .ssh folder then we can use them instead of creating one.
-> if we have a file called ID_RSA and ID_RSA.pub that means we already have a set of SSH keys
    -> or else if we do not have files inside .ssh folder... then run come commands to create SSH keys to use

Commands to create SSH keys:
--------------------------------------------------------
-> to generate new key:
1st cmd >>>
      "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b C" >>> to generate a key pair -t(type of) rsa protocol (rsa does not have abbreviation); -b -> bits for a key... so the common value will be 4096 bits; last is capital "C" -> to provide comments

-> to start new private key if created:
2nd cmd >>>
      eval $(ssh-agent -s) -> on windows to start the key
      eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" -> on mac and linux to start
... this starts the SSH agent by providing a process id. (agent pid "some number")

-> to register the file:
3rd cmd >>>
      ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa         >>>     (windows / linux)
      ssh-add -k ~/.ssh/id_rsa      >>>     (mac)
... this adds the key

Conclusion >>>
1. we can facilitate an SSH communication using key pair
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
--------------------------------------------------- Pushing code to Github ---------------------------------------------------
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1st... we have to configure SSH inside GitHub >>> to do this >>> visit GitHub -> Settings -> left hand side... SSH and GPG keys
-> so here we need to give the public key (id_rsa.pub) to github for configuration.
-> this process creates secure connection.

2nd... GitHub -> Settings -> left hand side... SSH and GPG keys >>> here select new SSH key
-> here github asks title and contents of the public key inside id_rsa.pub
-> to get the contents of that file -> run some commands inside a terminal

3rd... commands >>> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
-> cat                  >>>         concatenates the contents of the file
-> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub        >>>         path to the file (where it gets the content)

4th... grab the string it generated
-> starts from the ssh-rsa and ends with comment we have provided while generating.
-> paste the key inside GitHub key box and click "add SSH key" to add.

5th...
-> at last use the command >>> git push -u origin main (main / master according to the default branch on GITHUB)
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
--------------------------------------------------- Pushing code to Heroku ---------------------------------------------------
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1. in this we deploy our node js applications to heroku... we get a new URL.

steps to be followed:
-----------------------------------
-> we can manage to send the code on our local machine... to heroku from the terminal using heroku's command line tools that we have installed.
-> using the command line tools we can create apps, manage apps and to push new versions of our apps.

1st step >>> set up SSH public key file with Heroku
-> go to the .ssh directory --- open the command prompt from that path --- and enter the below command
-> "heroku keys:add" run this command
-> this searches for any public keys from the SSH directory --- and asks to upload it to heroku --- asks to enter "y" for yes

Note:
-----------
now we can send our code to heroku securely.

1. add a script in package.json >>> "start": "node src/app.js" >>> node app folder path
2. change the PORT value to "process.env.PORT || < user-defined port (3000 / 5500 / 8800) >"
3. change the code where we fetch data from the localhost server. (take help from: ChatGPT)

2nd >>> process - to create application
----------------
-> visit heroku webpage >>> click on new button >>> create new app
-> choose the app name >>> click on "create app" button
-> follow the commands to create an app:
    1. heroku login
    2. cd my-project/ -> (project directory)
    3. git init
    4. heroku git:remote -a "app-name"
    5. git add .
    6. git commit -am "make it better"
    7. git push heroku master

3rd >>> to handle errors
---------------
-> heroku logs --tail to log the errors

conclusion:
----------------------
-> take the help of ChatGPT to solve the errors

--------------------------------------------------- Avoiding Global Modules --------------------------------------------------
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1. setup a 2nd script in package.json (Development script)
-----------------------
-> if we wanna start the app every time we have to use the command " nodemon src/app.js -e js,hbs" (-e for extensions)
-> add: -----------------                       "dev": "nodemon src/app.js -e js,hbs"
-> now run the script: -----------------        " npm run dev "
-> with this it would be easier to start the dev server without typing the whole script again

2. Global Modules:
intro ----------------------------
-> Nodemon is a Global module
-> global modules are not the local-dev dependencies.
    -> when someone wants to add a functionality to our project they can install the modules which are available inside package.json
    -> but they can not install the global modules.

Solve this ----------------------------
-> uninstall any global module and install it as a local dev dependency.
-> to uninstall a global module, we use command -> " npm uninstall -g nodemon "
-> to install a module as a local dev dependency -> " npm install nodemon --save-dev " (--save-dev >>> installs a module as a dev dependency)

why as a dev dependency?
-> we are installing a module for local machine but not on production environment.
-> as heroku uses "start" script but not "dev" script

conclusion:
------------------
-> while using nodemon as a dev dependency execute the app using script but not the whole nodemon command
-> DO NOT USE: " nodemon src/app -e js,hbs "
-> USE: " npm run dev "
