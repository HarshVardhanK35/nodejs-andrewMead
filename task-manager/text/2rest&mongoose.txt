//Rest APIs and Mongoose//
Intro...
1. Here we can create our express-based REST API.
2. we are going to explore Mongoose when working with Node and MongoDB.
3. Mongoose which is easy for modeling data
4. we are going to set various data fields and data types for data validation.

(visit "mongoosejs.com" for more details...)

* setting up Mongoose...
Intro...
-> for docs which fields are required and which are optional and what types of data that I expect.
("task-completion" field need to be boolean not to be a string) --- this is "validation"
-> with mongoose we can add "authentication" to an app.
-> with mongoose we can create "model"
-> mongoose uses the mongodb behind the scenes.

Model.
1. this allows us to model something in the real world so that we can store in the database.
(if we are creating an "IKEA" website we have to  model various furniture with their names, price, dimensions)
2. we use these models to describe the data inside DB.

Mongoose
1. this provides straight, schema-based solution to model app data
2. includes built-in type-casting, Query-building, business logic hooks and more

-> Mongoose falls under broader category of tools known as ODMs (ODM - Object Document Mapper)
(that is with mongoose... objects in NodeJS app over to docs inside mongodb database)

1. Install... "npm i mongoose".
2. directory tree... task-manager(D) -> src(D) -> db(D) -> mongoose.js(F).
3. For more details about the code follow the above folder structure to review the code.

// to connect to the DB
......................... mongoose.connect()
-> takes in connectionURL and options object {useNewUrlParser: true, useCreateIndex: true}
-> with options setting to true... when mongoose works with mongodb indexes are created allows us to access data we need to access
-> to create a model we use mongoose.model()

ex:
// connect to the database --- takes connection URL, options
mongoose.connect("connectionURL")
  .then(() => {console.log("connected to database")})
  .catch((err) => {console.log(err)});

// create a model using mongoose.model() which takes 2 args... string-name for model and schema definition for all of the fields
const User = mongoose.model('User', {
  name: { type: String },
  age: { type: Number }
})

// create instances to add documents to DB
const user1 = new User({
  name: "user-1",
  age: 23
})

// save to the DB use methods on the instance that we have created
user1.save()
.then(() => { console.log(user1) })
.catch((err) => { console.log(err) })

* Data visualization and sanitization: P-1

Validation:
-> rules for data.
-> validating a document by setting --- required: true (for not an optional field)

Sanitization:
-> altering the data before saving it.
-> sanitizing a field value by removing extra spaces around

1. when a required field is not provided we get an error and parsing that will help user to know where the error actually happened
2. if that field is not set to required then it is an optional

-> so to validate other fields like (age, phone number and others) we can use our own validate() function
-> to validate age...
  validate(value){
    if (value < 0) {
      throw new Error("Age must be a positive number!")
    }
  }
-> to validate other fields like (numbers, social security number etc) we have an NPM library  "validator"
-> to install: "npm i validator"
-> and import into application using "require()" function

Sanitization:

1. trim, lowercase, uppercase, match(regexp), min and max lengths.
-> these takes the values as boolean, regexp and number etc.
trim: true or minLength or maxLength: Number

2. schema types:
-> required, default, validate etc. as properties
-> these takes function string boolean as values
