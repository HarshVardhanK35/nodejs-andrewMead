------------------------------------------------------------------------- Section- 3 -> Node.js Module System -------------------------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------ 3.1 -> import node.js core modules ------------------------------------------

---> The modules we use to work need to be imported using require function.
---> FILE SYSTEM: module allows to access the files on OS we're working on.

1. 1st method --- fs.writeFileSync and fs.writeFile:
--->  takes two arguments:
  1. file name;
  2. the contents to insert in it.
Note:
-> creates a file and write some data into it (it there is no file in the working directory)
-> overwrites content to a file (if the given file name already exists in the working directory)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------ 3.2 -> import created files ------------------------------------------

1. To load in a file that we create in the same working directory we use same require function
2. To import a variable or any object
  Note:
    (everything in JS is treated as an object)
  -> we have to use...
    1. "module.exports = <variable/ object name>" to export the variable from a file
    2. require statement in the file where we import the certain variable or an object
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------ 3.3 -> import NPM modules ------------------------------------------

Intro:
-> when we install nodejs into our local machine... npm also comes with it
-> NPM was already installed on our machine... this gives us the access to differ NPM modules
-> to use these NPM modules...

1. initialize NPM in our project:
-> run single cmd... <npm init -y>
-> it initializes the NPM in our project and creates configuration file to manage all of the dependencies
-> after initialization it adds "package.json" into working directory (we use this to manage all the installed packages)

2. install the necessary modules (which we use inside our project)
-> run the cmd... <npm i "package-name"@"version">
  --- "i" for install
-> when we install... package-lock.json and node_modules have been added into directory
-> we load the package inside working file using... "require" function.

ex: we installed "validator" package
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------ 3.4 -> Printing in color ------------------------------------------

1. In this chapter,
-> we install "chalk"
  -> utility which allows us to customize how text gets printed to the console
  -> customize the print logs for the server (print errors in "red" background and success messages in "green")
2. CHALLENGE:
-> Install "CHALK" and load it into app.js
-> Use it to print string "SUCCESS" to the console in "green"
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------ 3.5 -> Global npm modules and nodemon ------------------------------------------
intro:
1. so far we worked with locally installed packages because the packages are listed in the package.json file.
  -> these get loaded into our working file using "require()" function.
2. when we install a package globally we do not load it in directly into our working files.

-> We are going to install "NODEMON" which runs application whenever there is a change in our code.
-> To install a package globally use... <npm i "package-name"@version -g>

------------------------------------------------------------------------- Section- 4 -> File System and Command Line Args -------------------------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------ 4.1 -> Intro: File System and Command Line Args ------------------------------------------
intro to the section:
-> We put all the things we learnt from previous section into this... to build a NOTES TAKING APPLICATION.
-> we mainly focus on two things...
  1. File System.                                 ---                 Used to store the user's node data
  2. Command Line Arguments.                      ---                 Allows us to get the input from the User

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------ 4.2 -> Getting input from Users ------------------------------------
Intro:
-> Getting input into application with cmd line arguments.

1. In section-2, we have discussed about how the browser has window and document... and node has global and process
2. So we can access the input passed on to the cmd line arguments using "PROCESS".
3. On process we have a method called "argv" argument vector      -.-.-     (contains an array of arguments provided)
4. process.argv[2] this gives us the intention of an user     ---     whether to add or remove a new notes.

5.1 if user is trying to add a note...
  -> get the note's title and body
5.2 if user is removing the note...
  -> need the title of the note that should be removed

6. we provide command line options...
  -> "--title" for title
  ex: --title="This is Title-1"

7. we got an entire title like this... <"--title="This is Title-1">
  -> so we have to parse the command line arguments simply, without using extra code

Next session: learn how to parse the command line Arguments
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------  4.3 -> Argument Parsing with Yargs: Part- 1 ------------------------------------

1. --title="This is Title-1"
  -> we have to extract key and value using YARGS       ---       used to parse the command line arguments.
  -> command to install: <npm i yargs>
  -> after installing import it into our working file

2. log to console... <yargs.argv>
  2.1 --- do not pass any arguments
    -> which returns an object containing... underscore property (_: []) and "$0" property which has name of the file that was executed
  2.2 --- pass arguments like... node app.cjs remove --title="This is Title-1"
    -> returns a parsed object contains... {_: ['remove'], title: "This is Title-1", '$0': "app.cjs"}
    -> returns the "remove" command and parsed options

3. with yargs we can customize our own commands
  -> In this notes_taking application     ---     user can "add", "remove" notes, "read" notes and "list" all the older notes
  -> to create a command with the help of YARGS...

    -> yargs.command({
      command: 'command-name'... (add/ remove / read / list),
      describe: 'description about the command',
      handler: 'takes in a function that runs when someone uses the commands'
    })

    Note:
    -> takes three properties... in which command name and the function are important
    -> There is no need of "describe" property

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------  4.4 -> Argument Parsing with Yargs: Part- 2 ------------------------------------
Intro:
-> In this section, we set up yargs to support options for each of our commands.

ex:
add command -> This needs the "title" and "body" of the note we are adding
remove command -> needs specific title of note to remove it
read command -> needs title that we are trying to read

-> For this to be done... set up another property on the configuration object.
-> "builder" is the property that takes an object of options
-> "builder" takes another object that is "title" option as per our notes_taking application.

  -> we can configure this title that it is required and the type must be of string
  -> builder: {
      title: {
        demandOption: true,
        type: string
      }
    }
  Note:
  -> demandOption     ---     sets the title option must be required and must be a type of string

-> at last to parse those arguments with yargs.parse()... instead of console.log(yargs.argv)

------------------------------------  4.5 -> Storing data with JSON ------------------------------------

1. created a text file in playground folder to explain how to store data in JSON format with FS module

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------  4.6 -> Adding a note ------------------------------------

1. How to export two or more things from a file and import things into another file:

-> exporting things...
-> export the things using module.exports with an object assigned to it.
module.exports = {
  function1: function1,
  function2: function2
}

-> importing things...
const functions from "file-path"

-> to use the functions...
functions.function1
functions.function2

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------  4.7 -> removing a note ------------------------------------

Modifications:
--------------
1. used "find" instead of "filter" method to get the duplicateNote
2. "find" returns only one item when it find a duplicate. but "filter" returns every duplicate item in the json data.
